    "   - If the instruction requires a **nuanced exploration**, where missing key details could compromise the quality of the response, opt for **retrieving-extract** to ensure that a comprehensive analysis is performed.\n",

Since our high-vote stock carries twenty votes per share, Adam will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval, including the election of the Company's directors. As a founder-led company, we believe that this voting structure aligns our interests in creating shareholder value. Adam is, however, committed to relinquishing control at a time when he no longer maintains a significant economic interest in The We Company and the share ownership of Adam and certain of his permitted transferees represents less than 5% of the aggregate number of thenoutstanding shares of our capital stock, at which time all of the outstanding high-vote stock would convert to having one vote per share.\\n## Table of Contents\\nAdam and Rebekah Neumann have committed to contribute at least $1 billion to charitable causes by the ten-year anniversary of the closing date of this offering. If that contribution is not met, the outstanding high-vote stock would convert to having ten votes per share. See '-Charitable Giving' below.\\n## Succession Planning\\nAs part of our transition to a public company, our board of directors has spent significant time planning for the transition from a privately controlled company to a public company and put considerable thought into succession planning. In particular, in connection with this offering we are taking measures to provide clarity as to how unexpected transitions in our leadership might occur.\\nIn the event that Adam is permanently disabled or deceased during the ten-year period commencing upon the completion of this offering, a committee will be formed for the sole purpose of selecting a new Chief Executive Officer. The composition of this committee will be as follows:\\nSource: [s1-form-large-file] wework-s1.md.\\nChunk UID: 38da61e3-61e3-405d-9baa-0efc2174d540.\",\n",
       "  '[2] ## Governmental Regulation\\n\\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and standards in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Like other market participants that operate in numerous jurisdictions and in various service lines, we must comply with a number of regulatory regimes to which we are subject. United States federal, state and local and foreign laws, rules, regulations and standards include employment laws, health and safety regulations, taxation regimes and laws and regulations that govern or restrict our business and activities in certain regions and with certain persons, including economic sanctions regulations, anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws. Some of our offerings also require registrations, permits, licenses and/or approvals from governmental agencies and regulatory authorities, some or all of which may be costly or time consuming to obtain.\\nIn addition, as a developer and operator of real estate, we are subject to local land-use requirements, including regulations that govern zoning, use, building and occupancy, regulations and standards that address indoor environmental requirements, laws that require places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, and various environmental laws and regulations which may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases on, under, in or from such property.\\nFurthermore, because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of personally identifiable information received from or generated by our members, we are also subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy, use of personal data and cybersecurity.\\n## Legal Proceedings\\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, intellectual property claims and commercial contract disputes. In addition, with respect to employees and others, we face and could in the future face a wide variety of claims, including discrimination (for example, based on gender, age, race or religious affiliation), sexual harassment, privacy, labor and employment, ERISA and disability claims. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and corporate resources to defend, could result in significant media coverage and negative publicity, and could be harmful to our reputation and our brand. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we are not currently a party to any litigation or regulatory proceeding that we expect to have a material adverse effect\\nthe outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we are not currently a party to any litigation or regulatory proceeding that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\\n## Our Leadership Team\\nThe following sets forth certain information relating to our co-founders and global leadership team as of June 30, 2019.\\n## Adam Neumann\\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board\\nAdam, 40, is one of our co-founders and has served as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board since our inception.

As such, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, in this prospectus, we have taken advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations regarding the provision of selected financial data and executive compensation arrangements. We have also taken advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards available to emerging growth companies. Accordingly, the information contained in this prospectus may be different from the information you might receive from other public companies. See 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsJOBS Act'.\\n## Our Principal Stockholder and Our Status as a Controlled Company\\nFollowing the completion of this offering, as a result of his share ownership, together with his voting arrangements with certain stockholders, Adam Neumann, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, will be able to exercise voting control with respect to an aggregate of                  shares of our Class A common stock,                  shares of our Class B common stock and                      shares of our Class C common stock, representing approximately     % of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock (or approximately     % of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock). Accordingly, Adam will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors. As a founder-led company, we believe that this voting structure aligns our interests in creating stockholder value.\\nBecause Adam will control a majority of our outstanding voting power, we will be a 'controlled company' under the corporate governance rules for -listed companies. Therefore, we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, such as the requirement that our board of directors have a compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. For at least some period following completion of this offering, we intend to take advantage of these exemptions.\\n## Corporate Information\\nThe We Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2019 as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WeWork Companies Inc. As a result of various reorganization transactions undertaken in July 2019, The We Company became the holding company of our business, and the then-stockholders of WeWork Companies Inc. became the stockholders of The We Company.\\nSource: [s1-form-large-file] wework-s1.md.\\nChunk UID: 1b17cb51-2820-4a9c-845e-279bb1fbf16c.\",\n",

       "  \"[5] ## Table of Contents\\n\\nAs part of this award, Adam received options to purchase an aggregate of 42,473,167 shares. All of Adam's awards vest over time based on Adam's continuing service as our Chief Executive Officer and contemplate up to a ten-year time horizon for full vesting. A majority of Adam's awards are also tied to the Company's performance as a public company, particularly an increase in our market capitalization that is sustained over a period of at least 60 days.\\nBy connecting these awards to service to the Company and long-term value creation, our board believes we have set the foundation for long-term incentive alignment between Adam and our stockholders. The awards provide as follows:\\n- · 9,438,481 options vest monthly over a period of five years following the date of grant;\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    - · 9,438,481 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions upon the completion of this offering, and vest monthly over a period of five years following the completion of this offering;\\n- · 7,078,861 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $50 billion, and vest monthly over a period of three years from that date;\\n- · 7,078,861 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $72 billion, and vest monthly over a period of two years from that date; and\\n- · 9,438,481 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $90 billion, and vest monthly over a period of two years from that date.\\nIn connection with the reorganization transactions the Company undertook in July 2019 to provide a corporate organization similar to a structure commonly referred to as an 'UP-C' structure, Adam's performance-based options described above were canceled. An equal number of profits interests in the UP-C structure were issued to Adam. All of the profits interests have the same vesting conditions as the performance-based options that were canceled, with time-based vesting commencing on the date the applicable performance goal is achieved. There is no tax receivables agreement in place to benefit any holder of profits interests.\\nShortly after the option awards were issued, Adam exercised the time-based option described above in exchange for a $362.1 million full recourse promissory note payable to the Company (with an interest rate of 2.89% and a maturity date of April 11, 2029). In August 2019, Adam repaid the promissory note (including interest) in full by surrendering to the Company all of the shares received in respect of the time-based option described above. Following the settlement of this loan, the Company issued to Adam the number of profits interests equal to the number of shares surrendered by Adam in settlement of the loan.\\nIn July 2019, WE Holdings LLC assigned residual rights related to 'we' family trademarks to the Company, which we desired to obtain following our rebranding in early 2019.

       "  \"[6] ## Real Estate Transactions\\n\\nAdam has led our vision about the future of how people work, live and grow and provided valuable real estate insights that have helped drive our growth strategy. Adam has also made personal investments in real estate based on his vision of the future of real estate. In the early days of our business, at a time when landlords were reluctant to recognize the benefits of WeWork as a tenant, Adam bought four buildings in order to help prove WeWork as a viable tenant to landlords. In December 2017, Adam expanded his participation in purchasing real estate by buying a majority interest in downtown San Jose development projects, a first step in pursuing the Company's vision for the future of cities.\\nAs we become a public company, our board of directors and Adam wanted to not only ensure the absence of any actual conflict of interest, but also avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest in relation to any of Adam's personal real estate investments. As a result, we are providing disclosure about all of these properties and, more importantly, have created a mechanism for an orderly transition of these properties from Adam's ownership that ensures the Company gets a favorable treatment in the transfer of these assets. Adam has committed not to purchase any additional properties with the purpose of making them available for our occupancy.\\n## Properties Leased to The We Company\\nWe are party to lease agreements for four commercial properties with landlord entities in which Adam has an ownership interest. These leases, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our operations and represent only four of our 528 locations as of June 1, 2019. For one of these four properties, we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity within one year following Adam acquiring his ownership interest, and in the other three cases we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity on the same day that Adam acquired his ownership interest. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we made cash payments totaling $3.1 million, $5.6 million and $8.0 million to the landlord/partnership entities under these leases. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received payments from the landlord/partnership entities in the form of tenant improvement reimbursements of $11.6 million related to these leases. During the six months ended June 30,\\n31, 2018, we received payments from the landlord/partnership entities in the form of tenant improvement reimbursements of $11.6 million related to these leases. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we made cash payments to the landlord/partnership entities totaling $4.2 million under these leases and received no tenant improvement reimbursements related to these leases. As of June 30, 2019, future undiscounted minimum lease payments under these leases were approximately $236.6 million, which represents 0.5% of the Company's total lease commitments as of June 30, 2019.\\n## Personal Real Estate Transactions\\nIn connection with the formation of ARK, we decided to consolidate all of our real estate investment opportunities in ARK. As part of this consolidation, in August 2019 Adam entered into a management agreement with ARK Capital Advisors, LLC, which serves as the manager of the ARK acquisition vehicles and is referred to as the ARK Manager, pursuant to which the ARK Manager will exclusively manage all of Adam's interests in ten commercial properties owned by Adam, including the four leased properties discussed above. The purpose of this management agreement is to provide the Company with the ability to take advantage of the real estate opportunities Adam had identified, while at the same time eliminating any conflict of interest between Adam and the Company.\\nSource: [s1-form-large-file] wework-s1.md.\\nChunk UID: a7c4135d-906a-470f-beb7-515397f9c7a2.\"]}"
