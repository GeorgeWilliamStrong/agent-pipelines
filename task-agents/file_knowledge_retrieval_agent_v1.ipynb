From the day he co-founded WeWork, Adam has set the Company’s vision, strategic direction, and execution priorities. Adam is a unique leader who has proven he can simultaneously wear the hats of visionary, operator, and innovator, while thriving as a community and culture creator. Given his deep involvement in all aspects of the growth of our company, Adam’s personal dealings have evolved across a number of direct and indirect transactions and relationships with the Company. As we make the transition to a public company, we aim to provide clarity and transparency on the history of these relationships and transactions, as well as the background to the strategic governance decisions that have been made by Adam and the Company.\\nThis section also addresses Rebekah Neumann, one of our co-founders who serves as the Company’s Chief Brand and Impact Officer as well as the founder and CEO of WeGrow. Rebekah has been a strategic thought partner to Adam since our founding and has actively shaped the mission and strategy of The We Company and its global impact agenda, as well as being the primary voice and leading advocate for the We brand. Rebekah has never been paid a salary from us.\\nSpecifically, this section covers:\\n- Voting controls\\n- Succession planning\\n- Sale of shares\\n- Employment agreement\\n- Equity awards\\n- Charitable giving\\n- Real estate transactions\\n- Company and personal loans\\n- Family relationships\\n## Voting Controls\\nAdam controls a majority of the Company’s voting power, principally as a result of his beneficial ownership of our high-vote stock. Since our high-vote stock carries twenty votes per share, Adam will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to the Company’s stockholders for approval, including the election of the Company’s directors. As a founder-led company, we believe that this voting structure aligns our interests in creating shareholder value. Adam is, however, committed to relinquishing control at a time when he no longer maintains a significant economic interest in The We Company and the share ownership of Adam and certain of his permitted transferees represents less than 5% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of our capital stock, at which time all of the outstanding high-vote stock would convert to having one vote per share.\\nAdam and Rebekah Neumann have committed to contribute at least $1 billion to charitable causes by the ten-year anniversary of the closing date of this offering. If that contribution is not met, the outstanding high-vote stock would convert to having ten votes per share. See “—Charitable Giving” below.\\n## Succession Planning\\nAs part of our transition to a public company, our board of directors has spent significant time planning for the transition from a privately controlled company to a public company and put considerable thought into succession planning. In particular, in connection with this offering we are taking measures to provide clarity as to how unexpected transitions in our leadership might occur.\\nIn the event that Adam is permanently disabled or deceased during the ten-year period commencing upon the completion of this offering, a committee will be formed for the sole purpose of selecting a new Chief Executive Officer. The composition of this committee will be as follows:\\n- Bruce Dunlevie and Steven Langman, who are currently members of our board of directors and members of our compensation and nominating committee, to the extent they are then serving as our directors, will serve on this selection committee with Rebekah Neumann (with the size of the committee fixed at two or three, as applicable); and\\n- if neither Bruce nor Steven is then serving as one of our directors, Rebekah will choose one or two board members who are serving at the time to serve on this selection committee with Rebekah.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: 54c25ddc-2bfb-40ae-85b4-312553e1c131.',\n",

Due to the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our high-vote stock and Class A common stock, the holders of our high-vote stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock, until such time that the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock owned by Adam and certain of his permitted transferees represents less than 5% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common\\nstock and Class C common stock owned by Adam and certain of his permitted transferees represents less than 5% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock. In addition, in the event of his death, the shares of high-vote stock that Adam owns will transfer to the persons or entities that he designates. In the event the designated persons or entities are permitted transferees (as defined in the certificate of incorporation), such shares of high-vote stock will not be subject to automatic conversion. Holders of shares of our high-vote stock will be able to significantly influence matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control will significantly limit your ability to influence corporate matters. In addition, if\\nsale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control will significantly limit your ability to influence corporate matters. In addition, if in the future we issue additional shares of high-vote stock, which carry twenty votes per share, holders of shares of Class A common stock carrying one vote per share will have their voting interests diluted disproportionate to their economic dilution.\\nFuture transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, and transfers of partnership interests in the We Company Partnership will generally result in nineteen twentieths of the corresponding shares of our Class C common stock being cancelled, in each case subject to certain exceptions including (i) transfers to affiliates (including immediate family members), (ii) transfers to other holders of Class B common stock, (iii) transfers by certain entities controlled by our co-founders to their partners, members, or stockholders, (iv) transfers of membership or other ownership interests in WE Holdings LLC to affiliates (including immediate family members) or to another stockholder, employee, or former employee of The We Company, (v) transfers to certain qualified charitable organizations, and (vi) transfers approved by our board of directors.

       "  '[4] # Table of Contents\\n## Risk Factors\\n\\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as more fully described under “Risk Factors” in this prospectus. These risks could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and could result in a loss of all or part of your investment. Some of these risks include:\\n- the sustainability of our rapid growth and our ability to manage our growth effectively;\\n- our ability to expand in new and existing markets and enhance our solutions and product and service offerings;\\n- our ability to achieve profitability at a company level in light of our history of losses;\\n- our ability to retain existing members and attract new members;\\n- risks related to the long-term and fixed-cost nature of our leases;\\n- risks relating to our ability to generate sufficient cash and to obtain financing on adequate terms;\\n- our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand;\\n- risks related to our transactions with related parties;\\n- our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer has control over key decision-making as a result of his control over a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and\\n- the success of our strategic partnerships.\\n## Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\\nWe will be treated as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), for certain purposes until the earlier of the date we complete this offering and December 31, 2019. As such, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, in this prospectus, we have taken advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations regarding the provision of selected financial data and executive compensation arrangements. We have also taken advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards available to emerging growth companies. Accordingly, the information contained in this prospectus may be different from the information you might receive from other public companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—JOBS Act”.\\n## Our Principal Stockholder and Our Status as a Controlled Company\\nFollowing the completion of this offering, as a result of his share ownership, together with his voting arrangements with certain stockholders, Adam Neumann, our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, will be able to exercise voting control with respect to an aggregate of shares of our Class A common stock, shares of our Class B common stock, and shares of our Class C common stock, representing approximately % of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock (or approximately % of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock). Accordingly, Adam will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors. As a founder-led company, we believe that this voting structure aligns our interests in creating stockholder value.\\nBecause Adam will control a majority of our outstanding voting power, we will be a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules for listed companies. Therefore, we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, such as the requirement that our board of directors have a compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. For at least some period following completion of this offering, we intend to take advantage of these exemptions.\\n## Corporate Information\\nThe We Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2019 as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of WeWork Companies Inc. As a result of various reorganization transactions undertaken in July 2019, The We Company became the holding company of our business, and the then-stockholders of WeWork Companies Inc. became the stockholders of The We Company.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: 27a67185-615e-4f13-8780-7b97304e8c6c.',\n",

       "  '[8] # CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\n## Equity Awards\\n\\nAs part of this award, Adam received options to purchase an aggregate of 42,473,167 shares. All of Adam’s awards vest over time based on Adam’s continuing service as our Chief Executive Officer and contemplate up to a ten-year time horizon for full vesting. A majority of Adam’s awards are also tied to the Company’s performance as a public company, particularly an increase in our market capitalization that is sustained over a period of at least 60 days.\\nBy connecting these awards to service to the Company and long-term value creation, our board believes we have set the foundation for long-term incentive alignment between Adam and our stockholders. The awards provide as follows:\\n- 9,438,481 options vest monthly over a period of five years following the date of grant;\\n- 9,438,481 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions upon the completion of this offering, and vest monthly over a period of five years following the completion of this offering;\\n- 7,078,861 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $50 billion, and vest monthly over a period of three years from that date;\\n- 7,078,861 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $72 billion, and vest monthly over a period of two years from that date; and\\n- 9,438,481 options meet the performance-based vesting conditions if we attain a public market capitalization of $90 billion, and vest monthly over a period of two years from that date.\\nIn connection with the reorganization transactions the Company undertook in July 2019 to provide a corporate organization similar to a structure commonly referred to as an “UP-C” structure, Adam’s performance-based options described above were canceled. An equal number of profits interests in the UP-C structure were issued to Adam. All of the profits interests have the same vesting conditions as the performance-based options that were canceled, with time-based vesting commencing on the date the applicable performance goal is achieved. There is no tax receivables agreement in place to benefit any holder of profits interests.\\nShortly after the option awards were issued, Adam exercised the time-based option described above in exchange for a $362.1 million full recourse promissory note payable to the Company (with an interest rate of 2.89% and a maturity date of April 11, 2029). In August 2019, Adam repaid the promissory note (including interest) in full by surrendering to the Company all of the shares received in respect of the time-based option described above. Following the settlement of this loan, the Company issued to Adam the number of profits interests equal to the number of shares surrendered by Adam in settlement of the loan.\\nIn July 2019, WE Holdings LLC assigned residual rights related to “we” family trademarks to the Company, which we desired to obtain following our rebranding in early 2019. In consideration of this contribution and in lieu of paying cash, the Company issued to WE Holdings LLC partnership interests in the We Company Partnership with a fair market value of approximately $5.9 million, which was determined pursuant to a third-party appraisal.\\n## Charitable Giving\\nIn connection with this offering, Rebekah and Adam are dedicating additional resources to amplify the positive global impact of our organization. This effort is designed to enable us to scale our social and global impact as the Company grows. Rebekah and Adam Neumann have pledged $1 billion to fund charitable causes. To fulfill this pledge, Rebekah and Adam will contribute cash and equity to charitable causes within the 10 years following this offering. Their first contribution aids in the conservation of over 20 million acres of intact tropical forest, including the region pictured on the final page of this prospectus.\\nTo evidence their commitment to charitable causes and to ensure this commitment is meaningful, if Adam and Rebekah have not contributed at least $1 billion to charitable causes as of the ten-year anniversary of the closing date of this offering, holders of all of the Company’s high-vote stock will only be entitled to ten votes per share instead of twenty votes per share.\\nOver the years, Adam has sold some of his shares of the Company, with the last sale occurring in late 2017. To date, Adam and Rebekah have donated to charity an amount equal to over 15% of their past sales of shares of the Company.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: f626db37-7885-499d-ba75-8fe5960f170c.',\n",
       "  '[9] # CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\\n## Real Estate Transactions\\n\\nAdam has led our vision about the future of how people work, live, and grow and provided valuable real estate insights that have helped drive our growth strategy. Adam has also made personal investments in real estate based on his vision of the future of real estate. In the early days of our business, at a time when landlords were reluctant to recognize the benefits of WeWork as a tenant, Adam bought four buildings in order to help prove WeWork as a viable tenant to landlords. In December 2017, Adam expanded his participation in purchasing real estate by buying a majority interest in downtown San Jose development projects, a first step in pursuing the Company’s vision for the future of cities.\\nAs we become a public company, our board of directors and Adam wanted to not only ensure the absence of any actual conflict of interest but also avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest in relation to any of Adam’s personal real estate investments. As a result, we are providing disclosure about all of these properties and, more importantly, have created a mechanism for an orderly transition of these properties from Adam’s ownership that ensures the Company gets favorable treatment in the transfer of these assets. Adam has committed not to purchase any additional properties with the purpose of making them available for our occupancy.\\n### Properties Leased to The We Company\\nWe are party to lease agreements for four commercial properties with landlord entities in which Adam has an ownership interest. These leases, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our operations and represent only four of our 528 locations as of June 1, 2019. For one of these four properties, we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity within one year following Adam acquiring his ownership interest, and in the other three cases we entered into a lease agreement with the landlord/partnership entity on the same day that Adam acquired his ownership interest. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we made cash payments totaling $3.1 million, $5.6 million, and $8.0 million to the landlord/partnership entities under these leases. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received payments from the landlord/partnership entities in the form of tenant improvement reimbursements of $11.6 million related to these leases. During the six months ended June\\n31, 2018, we received payments from the landlord/partnership entities in the form of tenant improvement reimbursements of $11.6 million related to these leases. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, we made cash payments to the landlord/partnership entities totaling $4.2 million under these leases and received no tenant improvement reimbursements related to these leases. As of June 30, 2019, future undiscounted minimum lease payments under these leases were approximately $236.6 million, which represents 0.5% of the Company’s total lease commitments as of June 30, 2019.\\n### Personal Real Estate Transactions\\nIn connection with the formation of ARK, we decided to consolidate all of our real estate investment opportunities in ARK. As part of this consolidation, in August 2019 Adam entered into a management agreement with ARK Capital Advisors, LLC, which serves as the manager of the ARK acquisition vehicles and is referred to as the ARK Manager, pursuant to which the ARK Manager will exclusively manage all of Adam’s interests in ten commercial properties owned by Adam, including the four leased properties discussed above. The purpose of this management agreement is to provide the Company with the ability to take advantage of the real estate opportunities Adam had identified, while at the same time eliminating any conflict of interest between Adam and the Company.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: 60de9d6d-4e46-4d65-9315-8451fc2f0e37.',\n",
