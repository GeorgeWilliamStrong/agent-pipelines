This rapid growth places a significant strain on our existing resources. Difficulties associated with our continued growth could result in harm to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our prospects for continued growth, and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe expect our capital expenditures and operating expenses to increase on an absolute basis as we continue to invest in additional locations, launch additional solutions, products and services, hire additional team members, and increase our marketing efforts. In particular, we expect to continue to invest in local infrastructure to support our continued growth. As we continue to decentralize and localize certain decision-making and risk management functions, we may discover that our internal processes are ineffective or inefficient. In particular, to manage our rapid growth, we will need to enhance our reporting systems and procedures and continue to improve our operational, financial, management, sales and marketing, and information technology infrastructure. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our members. If we do not manage our growth effectively, increases in our capital expenditures and operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue, which\\nreliable service levels for our members.

       "  '[2] # RISK FACTORS\\n## Risks Relating to Our Business\\n### Our rapid growth may not be sustainable.\\n\\nOur historical growth rates may not be indicative of future growth. The market for our solutions, products and services may not continue to grow at the rate we expect or at all, and our memberships may decline as a result of increased competition in the space-as-a-service sector or the maturation of our business. Additionally, as we grow, the ability of our management to source sufficient reasonably-priced opportunities for new locations of the type we have historically targeted or to develop and launch additional solutions, products and services may become more limited.\\n### Our business strategy includes entering into new markets and introducing new solutions, products and services. This strategy is inherently risky, may not be successful and could be costly.\\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue expansion into additional locations in existing and new markets within the United States and throughout the world, while also enhancing our product and service offerings. We may also continue to pursue new strategic opportunities, including real estate acquisition and management. Such expansion efforts also generally involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from our existing solutions, products and services and the operations of our existing locations. As we attempt to grow our foothold in an evolving industry and acquire new businesses that enhance value for our members, we may encounter issues and risks not discovered in our development or analysis of such expansion efforts. Our operations in any new markets or solutions, products and services into which we expand may also generate less revenue or cash flow than our core WeWork space-as-a-service offering in our existing locations.\\nOur expansion efforts have required, and we expect them to continue to require, substantial resources and management attention. We spend significant time, money, energy, and other resources trying to understand our members’ needs and working to accommodate them, which may include exploring and negotiating for new solutions, products, and services. However, as we expand into new markets and introduce new solutions, products, and services, our members may not be satisfied with our solutions, products, and services, including any new offerings that we launch. The time, money, energy, and other resources we dedicate to exploring and pursuing new solutions, products, and services may be greater than the short-term, and potentially the total, returns from these new offerings.\\nWe will also face new operational risks and challenges as we continue to enter into new markets. Expansion into foreign jurisdictions subjects us to legal, regulatory, economic, and political risks that may be different from and additional to those that we face in jurisdictions where we currently operate, and we may operate at a disadvantage relative to competitors who are more familiar with local market practices and networks. Expansion into new solutions, products, and services subjects us to similar risks as we compete with the many established participants in those markets, and we face additional regulatory, legal, and execution risks as we implement new business practices and integrate a new offering into our existing range of solutions, products, and services. To the extent the benefits of our expansion efforts do not meet our expectations, we may recognize a loss on our investment or gains that do not justify our investment. See “—We plan to continue expanding our business into markets outside the\\nefforts do not meet our expectations, we may recognize a loss on our investment or gains that do not justify our investment. See “—We plan to continue expanding our business into markets outside the United States, which will subject us to risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions.”\\nOur success in this regard may increasingly depend on the financial success and cooperation of local partners and other third parties.

For example, average revenue per WeWork membership has declined as we have expanded internationally into lower-priced markets, which is a trend we expect could continue in the near term. Also, our overall contribution margin percentage may decline as certain lower margin markets, including markets with a larger target member population such as China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia become a larger portion of our portfolio. Our contribution margin metrics may also be impacted by the speed at which we can open locations and stabilize occupancy at those locations as well as the average revenue per WeWork membership that we generate.\\nWe face risks arising from strategic transactions such as acquisitions and investments that we evaluate, pursue, and undertake.\\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential strategic acquisition or investment opportunities, and from time to time we pursue and undertake certain of those opportunities. We have expanded rapidly, including through acquisitions of companies engaged in a variety of businesses, including Meetup (an online platform that brings people together offline) and Flatiron School (a software programming education platform). We plan to continue to pursue and complete acquisitions or investments, some of which may be material and may not create the value that we expect. We also plan to continue or accelerate investments in real estate vehicles, including as we grow our ARK real estate acquisition and management platform.\\nAny transactions that we enter into could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We have limited experience in completing and integrating major acquisitions. The process of acquiring and integrating another company or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and could entail unforeseen liabilities that are not recoverable under the relevant transaction agreements or otherwise.\\nThe integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks which may include but are not limited to:\\n- the assimilation and retention of personnel, including management personnel, in the acquired businesses;\\n- accounting, tax, regulatory, and compliance issues that could arise;\\n- expenses and difficulties in the transition and integration of operations and systems;\\n- unanticipated expenses incurred or charges to earnings based on unknown circumstances or liabilities;\\n- failure to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition, at the pace we anticipate or at all;\\n- general economic conditions in the markets in which the acquired business operates; and\\n- difficulties encountered in conducting business in markets where we have limited experience and expertise.\\nIf we are unable to successfully complete and integrate our strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business, growth strategies, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe have entered into certain agreements that may limit our ability to directly acquire ownership interests in properties, and our control and joint ownership of certain properties with third-party investors may create conflicts of interest.\\nWe hold an ownership interest in ARK, our real estate acquisition and management platform, through our majority ownership of the general partner and manager entities that manage the activities of real estate acquisition vehicles managed or sponsored by ARK. In connection with the formation of ARK, we agreed that ARK would be the exclusive general partner and investment manager for any real estate acquisition vehicles managed by, or otherwise affiliated with, The We Company and its controlled affiliates and associated persons. We also agreed to make commercial real estate and other real estate-related investment opportunities that meet ARK’s mandate available to ARK on a first-look basis, with certain limited exceptions. Because of these requirements, which are in effect at least until there are no real estate acquisition vehicles managed or sponsored by ARK that are actively deploying capital, we may be required to acquire ownership interests in properties through ARK that we otherwise could have acquired\\nacquisition vehicles managed or sponsored by ARK that are actively deploying capital, we may be required to acquire ownership interests in properties through ARK that we otherwise could have acquired through one of our operating subsidiaries, which may prevent us from realizing the full benefit of certain attractive real estate opportunities.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: 4a8e511e-6bb6-425c-85c9-cfcac16fac8d.',\n",
       "  '[4] # RISK FACTORS\\n## Risks Relating to Our Business\\n### We have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level (as determined in accordance with GAAP) for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWe had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 and as of June 30, 2018 and 2019 and had net losses of $0.4 billion, $0.9 billion, and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, and $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019. Our accumulated deficit and net losses have historically resulted primarily from the substantial investments required to grow our business, including the significant increase in recent periods in the number of locations we operate. We expect that these costs and investments will continue to increase as we continue to grow our business. We also intend to invest in maintaining our high level of member service and support, which we consider critical to our continued success. We also expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of our growth. These expenditures will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability, and we cannot predict whether we will achieve\\nadditional general and administrative expenses as a result of our growth. These expenditures will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability, and we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability for the foreseeable future. Although we do not currently believe our net loss will increase as a percentage of revenue in the long term, we believe that our net loss may increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term and will continue to grow on an absolute basis.\\n### Our operating costs and other expenses may be greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business and our operations more efficient may not be successful.\\nIncreases in our costs, expenses, and investments may reduce our margins and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, non-mature locations and pipeline locations may not generate revenue or cash flow comparable to those generated by our existing mature locations, and our mature locations may not be able to continue to generate existing levels of revenue or cash flow. Further, our We Company offerings, such as WeLive, WeGrow, Flatiron School, and Meetup, and additional We Company offerings that we may launch or acquire in the future, may not generate meaningful revenue or cash flow. For any of these reasons, we may be unable to achieve profitability for the foreseeable future and may face challenges in growing our cash flows.\\n### We may not be able to continue to retain existing members, most of whom enter into membership agreements with short-term commitments, or to attract new members in sufficient numbers or at sufficient rates to sustain and increase our memberships or at all.\\nWe principally generate revenues through the sale of memberships. We have in the past experienced, and expect to continue to experience, membership agreement terminations. In many cases, our members may terminate their membership agreements with us at any time upon as little notice as one calendar month. Members may cancel their memberships for many reasons, including a perception that they do not make sufficient use of our solutions and services, that they need to reduce their expenses, or that alternative work environments may provide better value or a better experience.\\n### Our results of operations could be adversely affected by declines in demand for our memberships.\\nDemand for our memberships may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including geopolitical uncertainty, competition, cybersecurity incidents, decline in our reputation, and saturation in the markets where we operate. Prevailing general and local economic conditions may also negatively affect the demand for our memberships, particularly from current and potential members that are small- and mid-sized businesses and may be disproportionately affected by adverse economic conditions.\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: f28fe51d-65bc-46c8-8f02-3d1e328b7f36.',\n",

Any existing or new government regulations or ordinances that relate to our development activities may result in significant additional expenses to us and, as a result, might adversely affect our results of operations.\\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and therefore our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states, and other jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in applying the relevant provisions of tax law.\\nIf such changes were to be adopted or if the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate were to challenge our application of relevant provisions of applicable tax laws, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nFailure by certain of our subsidiaries in complying with laws and regulations applicable to investment platforms, including the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), could result in substantial harm to our reputation and results of operations.\\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations applicable to investment platforms, including those applicable to investment advisers under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations, and prohibitions on self-dealing. The failure of any of these subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations, including censure, or to terminate the registration of our subsidiaries as investment advisers or prohibit them from serving as an investment adviser to SEC-registered funds. Similarly, these subsidiaries rely on exemptions from various requirements of ERISA to the extent these subsidiaries receive investments by benefit plan investors.

The failure of our relevant subsidiaries to comply with these laws and regulations could irreparably harm our reputation or lead to litigation or regulatory or other legal proceedings, any of which could harm our results of operations.\\n## Risks Relating to Our Organizational Structure\\nOur only material assets are our indirect interests in the We Company Partnership, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from the We Company Partnership to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses.\\nThe We Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than an indirect general partner interest and indirect limited partner interests in the We Company Partnership. The We Company has no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause our subsidiaries (including the We Company Partnership) to make distributions in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes and other expenses payable and dividends, if any, declared by us. The agreements governing our bank facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes impose, and the agreement governing the 2019 Credit Facility will impose, certain restrictions on distributions by WeWork Companies LLC to us, and may limit our ability to pay cash dividends.

For the six months ended June 30, 2019, 56% of our revenue was attributable to our operations in the United States and 44% of our revenue was attributable to our operations elsewhere, compared with 62% and 38% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. We expect to continue to expand our operations in markets outside the United States in the coming years.\\nWhile we have already expanded our operations to a number of non-U.S. markets, the success of our expansion into additional non-U.S. markets will depend on our ability to attract local members. The solutions, products, and services we offer may not appeal to potential members in all markets in the same way it appeals to our members in markets where we currently operate. In addition, local competitors may have a substantial competitive advantage over us in a given market because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, individuals and organizations in that market, as well as their more established local infrastructure and brands. We may also be unable to hire, train, retain, and manage the personnel we require in order to manage our international operations effectively, on a timely basis or at all, which may limit our growth in these markets. Further, we may experience variability in the terms of our leases (including rent per square foot) and in our capital expenditures as we move into new markets.\\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that may be different from and incremental to those that we face in the United States, including:\\n- the need to adapt the design and features of our locations and products and services to accommodate specific cultural norms and language differences;\\n- difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, including local labor laws, tax laws, environmental regulations, and rules and regulations related to occupancy of our locations;\\n- varying local building codes and regulations relating to building design, construction, safety, environmental protection, and related matters;\\n- significant reliance on third parties with whom we may engage in joint ventures, strategic alliances, or ordinary course contracting relationships whose interests and incentives may be adverse to or different from ours or may be unknown to us;\\n- varying laws, rules, regulations, and practices regarding protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including trademarks;\\n- varying laws, rules, regulations, and practices regarding protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including trademarks;\\n- laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and security, and encryption that may be more restrictive than comparable laws and regulations in the United States;\\n- corrupt or unethical practices in foreign jurisdictions that may subject us to compliance costs, including competitive disadvantages, or exposure under applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws;\\n- compliance with applicable export controls and economic sanctions, such as those administered by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control;\\n- fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with foreign exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of funds; and\\n- unpredictable disruptions as a result of security threats or political or social unrest and economic instability.\\nFinally, continued expansion in markets outside the United States will require significant financial and other investments. These investments include property sourcing and leasing, marketing to attract and retain new members, developing localized infrastructure and services, developing relationships with local partners and third-party service providers, further developing corporate capabilities able to support operations in multiple countries, and potentially entering into strategic transactions with or even acquiring companies based outside the United States and integrating those companies with our existing operations. If we continue to invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside the United States, but cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in those markets, including the investment of management attention, may be prohibitive, or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets.\\nAs we continue to grow our global platform in new markets, certain metrics may be impacted by the geographic mix of our platform. For example, average revenue per WeWork membership has declined as we have expanded internationally into lower-priced markets, which is a trend we expect could continue in the near term.

In addition, it may be difficult to evaluate our business because there are few other companies that offer the same or a similar range of solutions, products, and services as we do.\\nCertain of the measures we use to evaluate our financial and operating performance are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and may be impacted by subjective determinations and not necessarily by changes in our business.\\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key performance indicators such as memberships, workstation capacity, and enterprise membership percentage, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Certain of our operational metrics are also based on assumptions or estimates of future events. In particular, the tenant improvement reimbursement amounts used to calculate net capex per workstation added represent the full tenant improvement allowances in our leases with landlords, rather than the amounts we have collected from landlords or submitted for reimbursement. Similarly, the number of workstations in our open locations, pre-open locations, and pipeline locations is compiled from a number of data sources depending on the phase of the location within the lifecycle that we attribute to our locations. For open locations, workstation capacity for shared workspace offerings, which account for a subset of our standard workspace solutions, is estimated on a\\nSource: S-1 Wework.md.\\nChunk UID: 8358af51-0220-45f2-84bf-c983eec9329e.',\n",

The company may struggle to maintain its historical growth rates due to increased competition and market saturation. As it expands into new markets, the ability to find reasonably priced opportunities for new locations may become limited, which could hinder growth [1][2].\\n\\n2. **Operational Challenges**: The rapid expansion places a strain on WeWork's resources, potentially leading to operational inefficiencies. If the company fails to manage its growth effectively, it may face increased capital expenditures and operating costs that could outpace revenue growth, adversely impacting its financial results [1][4].\\n\\n3. **Profitability Concerns**: WeWork has a history of losses and may continue to face challenges in achieving profitability. The company has incurred significant net losses in recent years, and ongoing investments in growth and member services may further complicate its path to profitability [4][5].\\n\\n4. **Membership Retention and Demand**: The company relies heavily on membership sales for revenue. WeWork may struggle to retain existing members or attract new ones, especially if members perceive better value elsewhere or if economic conditions worsen. Factors such as geopolitical uncertainty and competition could negatively impact demand for memberships [4][5].\\n\\n5. **Regulatory and Compliance Risks**: Operating in multiple jurisdictions exposes WeWork to various regulatory, legal, and compliance risks. Changes in laws or regulations could lead to increased operational costs and affect the company's ability to conduct business effectively [5][6].\\n\\n6. **International Expansion Risks**: As WeWork continues to expand internationally, it faces unique challenges, including cultural differences, local competition, and regulatory hurdles. The success of its international operations depends on the ability to adapt its offerings to local markets, which may not always be successful [6][7].\\n\\n7. **Technological Dependence**: WeWork relies on a combination of proprietary and third-party technology systems to support its operations. Any disruptions or failures in these systems could adversely affect member experience and operational efficiency [8][9].\\n\\n8. **Market Competition**: The flexible workspace market has low barriers to entry, leading to increased competition.
