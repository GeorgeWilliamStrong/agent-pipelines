This document contains important information regarding the implementation of a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) for drinking water bacteriology testing. The new OpenELIS LIMS aims to enhance sample management, data integrity, and reporting capabilities, including direct electronic data exchange with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). Key changes include the introduction of new sample bottles and an Environmental Sample Collection Form, which replaces the traditional sample card. The new form will be pre-populated with essential information and requires a collector's signature to ensure accuracy.

The document outlines the timeline for transitioning to the new system, with a "go-live" date set for December 16, 2015. It also details revised sample collection instructions and emphasizes the importance of adhering to new protocols to avoid non-compliance reports. Additionally, a web portal will be available for public water systems to access test results and sample status in real time. For further assistance, contact information for relevant departments and personnel is provided.
