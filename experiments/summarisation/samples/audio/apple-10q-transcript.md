Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q2 FY 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Tejas Ghala, Director of Investment Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.

Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business results of operation. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.

I'd now like to turn over the call to Tim for introductory remarks. 

Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Apple is proud to report another strong quarter, one where we set new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings, besting our year-ago revenue performance by 54 percent. Reflecting both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives, as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead, we set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, and success was broadly distributed across our product categories. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and we set new March quarter records for iPhone and wearables, home, and accessories.

To provide some color on our results, let's turn to our product categories. We saw very strong performance for iPhone, which grew 66 percent year over year, driven by the strong popularity of the iPhone 12 family. With unmatched 5G capability, the best camera system ever in an iPhone, and advanced durability from Ceramic Shield, this family of devices is popular with both upgraders and new customers alike. And just last week, we unveiled an all-new purple finish for iPhone 12 and 12 mini.

As has been the case throughout the pandemic, iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been deployed to help students learn, creators create, and to enhance remote work in all of its forms. This has helped iPad grow very strong double digits to its highest March quarter revenue in nearly a decade. On Mac, fueled by the M1, we set an all-time revenue record, continuing the momentum for the product category. In fact, the last three quarters for Mac have been its three best quarters ever.

Last week, both iPad and Mac took a big step forward. We debuted a radically redesigned brand-new iMac designed around M1's unmatched capabilities, and we brought M1 to iPad for the first time in a new iPad Pro with 5G capability and a Liquid Retina XDR display. It was a quarter of sustained strength for wearables, home, and accessories, which grew by 25% year over year. Apple Watch is a global success story, and the category set March quarter records in each geographic segment thanks to strong performance from both Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE. 

It's an exciting and busy period ahead for wearables, home, and accessories with the launch of the next generation Apple TV 4K and our newest accessory, AirTag. AirTag builds on the powerful and incredibly useful Find My experience, helping users privately and securely keep track of the items that matter most to them. Third-party accessories and products can also make use of the Find My network, guaranteeing a great experience no matter what products you choose to use.

Turning to services, we achieved growth of 27% year over year and set new records for services in each of our geographic segments. We continue to enhance and improve our current service offerings from Apple Music to Apple News while continuing to launch new services that enhance our customers' lives. Just last week, we introduced Apple Card Family, which reinvents how you can share credit cards and build credit together. We also announced Apple Podcast Subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium content from their favorite creators and storytellers.

While we're on the topic of services, in many ways this quarter showed the unique value to customers created by Apple's belief in the deep integration of hardware, software, and services. Across our products and throughout our software ecosystem, we continue to deploy industry-leading new tools to protect users' fundamental right to privacy. In addition to the App Store privacy nutrition labels that we discussed on last quarter's call, we're proud to have launched the full implementation of app tracking transparency. This powerful yet simple idea gives users a choice over how their data is used and shared across the apps that they love and use every day.

No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations. Ted Lasso, in particular, has been recognized with a multitude of awards and nominations, including most recently an AFI Program of the Year recognition, Writers Guild of America awards, and a clean sweep at the Critics' Choice Awards. Apple TV+ also continues to be a place where we can tell stories that matter and lift up important voices and experiences, like our new upcoming content partnership with Malala, or our latest original documentary special, The Year the Earth Changed, narrated by the legendary David Attenborough and released to commemorate Earth Day.

This is, of course, just one example of how Apple lives its values and operationalizes the idea that to whom much is given, much is expected. To begin with our environmental efforts, just last week we marked a milestone Earth Day on multiple fronts. In addition to the progress we've made in our own efforts to achieve our pledge of a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 across our entire supply chain and use of our products, we're proud to play a role in the growing ripple of change taking place across the private sector. As of this month, 110 of our suppliers have joined us in our renewable energy commitment, and we will bring online nearly 8 gigawatts of new clean energy, the equivalent of taking 3.4 million gas-powered vehicles off the road each year.

Through Apple's $4.7 billion in green bonds and related efforts, we've supported transformative environmental projects around the world, from clean energy initiatives in China to two of the world's largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark to a 180-acre solar project outside Reno, Nevada, and many more. We're also keenly focused on how this wave of green innovation can lead to equitably shared prosperity. Through our new $200 million Restore Fund, we're helping local and rural communities around the world build sustainable industries around working forests, creating opportunities, and removing up to 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. 

And here in the United States, we started a Green Impact Accelerator, investing and supporting minority-owned businesses at the forefront of environmental fields. As we look forward to WWDC, we're taking new steps to foster and support the unmatched communities of developers we work with here in the United States and around the world. I'm particularly excited about our inaugural Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders and Developers, building on the success of our Entrepreneur Camp program, which we began in 2019. This program gives this profoundly innovative community of developers the chance to develop next-level technical skills through hands-on technology labs, and with our partners at Harlem Capital, it also shares insights and mentorship on building and scaling an app business.

We are proud to announce that we have expanded and accelerated our commitment to the U.S. economy. Over the next five years, we will invest $430 billion, creating 20,000 jobs in the process. The investments will support American innovation and drive economic benefits in every state, including a new North Carolina campus and job-creating investments in innovative fields like silicon engineering and 5G technology.

### Timestamp: 596.844 - 885.076 seconds
Looking forward, whether you're running a business or just hoping to see family again after more than a year, it's tempting at this moment to let hope about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic outstrip clear-eyed realism about the challenges we still face. In many places around the world, new waves of infections, driven by even more infectious variants of the virus, are prompting new lockdowns. Instead of simply assuming that the end is in sight, we at Apple are doing our part to make it a reality, beginning with an enduring and uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our teams and extending well beyond our walls into the communities where we work. 

We also want to do everything we can to connect users to life-saving vaccinations that are in ever greater supply. Through Apple Maps, for example, we now showcase vaccine site locations here in the United States, building on our maps of testing locations in many countries around the world. It's worth remembering, for much more than financial reasons or year-ago comparisons, just how we felt at this time last year when everything we knew had to change. Planes sat grounded. Entire business districts were empty and silent. People left groceries or care packages sitting in the garage or in the hall overnight in recognition of all that we didn't know and therefore had to imagine. 

Thanks to researchers and scientists, doctors and nurses, everyone who can put a shot in an arm and even just check a name off a list, we have reached new days of hopeful resolve. Our work's not done, but as I said a year ago, while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. 

With that, I'll hand things over to Luca. 

Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our March quarter, despite continued uncertainty in the microenvironment. We've been operating in new ways for over a year, and we could not be more proud of the way our team continues to execute and innovate at unprecedented levels. Our revenue reached a March quarter record of $89.6 billion, an increase of over $31 billion, or 54% from a year ago. 

We grew very strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for Mac and for services, and March quarter records for iPhone and for wearables, home, and accessories. We also set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, with growth of at least 35% in each one of them. Products revenue was a March quarter record of $72.7 billion, up 62% over a year ago. 

As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $16.9 billion, growing 27% over a year ago. We established new records in each geographic segment and in most service categories. I will provide more details about the performance of our services business later. 

Company gross margin was 42.5%, up 270 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings, a strong mix, and favorable foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.1%, growing 100 basis points sequentially, also thanks to cost savings and effects, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 70.1%, up 170 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. 

Net income of $23.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.40, and operating cash flow of $24 billion were all March quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $47.9 billion, growing 66% year over year, as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, as we grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set March quarter records in most markets we track.

### Timestamp: 886.124 - 1032.468 seconds
Thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem, our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of over 99% for the iPhone 12 family. 

Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record of $16.9 billion, with all-time records for the App Store, cloud services, music, video, advertising, and payment services. Our new service offerings—Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+, as well as the Apple One bundle—continue to scale across users, content, and features, contributing to overall services growth. 

The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base growth has accelerated and reached an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. 

Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth. During the March quarter, we added more than 40 million paid subscriptions sequentially, and we have now reached more than 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. This is up 145 million from just a year ago and twice the number of paid subscriptions we had only two and a half years ago. 

Finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. For example, Apple Arcade launched its biggest expansion yet, adding incredibly fun games to the catalog, including new exclusive arcade originals along with two entirely new categories: App Store Greats and Timeless Classics. Apple Pay continues to expand geographically, launching in Mexico and South Africa, bringing our payment service to six continents.

### Timestamp: 1034.092 - 1150.548 seconds
Wearables, homes, and accessories grew 25% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, setting new March quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. The Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We are very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software, and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experiences in this area. 

Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set an all-time revenue record of $9.1 billion, up 70% over last year, and grew very strongly in each geographic segment, with all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific, as well as March quarter records in the Americas, Greater China, and Japan. This amazing performance was driven by the enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip. 

iPad performance was also outstanding, with revenue of $7.8 billion, up 79%. We grew very strongly in every geographic segment, achieving an all-time record in Japan and a March quarter record in the rest of Asia Pacific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 91% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction, and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to those products, the active install base for both continues to grow nicely and reach new all-time highs.

### Timestamp: 1151.980 - 1211.668 seconds
In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of the iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business. Delta Airlines, for example, is putting the iPhone 12 and 5G connectivity into the hands of flight attendants so they can provide the best passenger service possible as air travel rebounds. Openreach in the UK has started equipping tens of thousands of field engineers with the iPhone 12 to speed up their deployment of broadband services to homes around the country. Additionally, UC Health, a large healthcare provider in Colorado, was able to reduce per patient vaccination time from three minutes to only 30 seconds, largely by moving from PC stations to iPhones. This has allowed their staff to rapidly scan and register new patients, vastly increasing their daily vaccination capacity.

### Timestamp: 1213.132 - 1312.852 seconds
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with over $204 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $14 billion of new term debt and retired $3.5 billion of term debt, leaving us with total debt of almost $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. This strong position allows us to continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. 

We are innovating and investing at an unprecedented pace, including accelerating our investment in the United States with our new commitment to contribute more than $430 billion and 20,000 jobs to the country over the next five years. As we continue to execute at an extremely high level, we were also able to return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 147 million Apple shares. 

We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We are also raising our dividend by 7% to $0.22 per share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward.

### Timestamp: 1314.444 - 1343.188 seconds
As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights, assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are seeing today for the current quarter.

### Timestamp: 1344.204 - 1436.276 seconds
We expect our June quarter revenue to grow strong double digits year over year. However, we believe that the sequential revenue decline from the March quarter to the June quarter will be greater than in prior years for two reasons. 

First, keep in mind that due to the later launch timing and strong demand, the iPhone only achieved supply-demand balance during the March quarter. This will cause a steeper sequential decline than usual. 

Second, we believe supply constraints will have a revenue impact of $3 to $4 billion in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OPEX to be between $11.1 and $11.3 billion. We expect OI&amp;E to be around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 14.5%. 

Finally, reflecting the approved 7% dividend increase I just mentioned, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock, payable on May 13, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2021. 

With that, let's open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

### Timestamp: 1438.508 - 1561.140 seconds
Thank you. Once again, if you'd like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We would like to ask you once again to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up before reentering the queue. 

We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.

Thank you very much. Kim, I have sort of a big picture question on iPhone. I'm just curious. There are so many different things happening in this cycle, you know, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers? Are you seeing lives shortened given some of the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of iPhone out there in the market.

Thank you. 

Sure, Shannon. We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new-to-iPhone and upgraders. In fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. We like what we see. It's obviously the early days of 5G. Different countries are at different points, but penetration on a global level is still low at this point. A lot of the 5G upgrades will be in front of us, not behind us. You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States, but a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.

### Timestamp: 1563.820 - 1652.084 seconds
Okay, thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean, 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember at this point. So maybe if you could discuss the drivers of gross margin, and if there were any offsets from higher component costs or logistics costs that were overshadowed by currency and other factors. 

Thank you. Yes, Shana. Yes, we achieved 42.5% during March, and we maintained similar, slightly lower levels for June. From March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by three major factors: cost savings, which have been beneficial for us during this cycle; a strong mix, particularly on iPhone, but generally across all product categories, which was obviously helpful; and favorable foreign exchange, which contributed 90 basis points sequentially from December to March. 

As we transition into June, we expect some level of deleverage, but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange will not have much of an impact as we move from March to June.

### Timestamp: 1654.284 - 1659.604 seconds
Thank you. Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 1660.780 - 1665.332 seconds
Absolutely. We'll now take our next question from Amit Duryani with Evercore.

### Timestamp: 1667.148 - 1688.884 seconds
Thank you for taking my question. I have two as well. The first one is just on services. I think 90 days ago, the expectation was that the line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter. It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd like to just understand what you think drove that acceleration specifically, and is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for services?

### Timestamp: 1690.508 - 1795.572 seconds
So, I mean, our services business did better than what we were expecting when we had the last call in January. It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that, you know, throughout COVID, obviously digital services have done very well. Then we've had a couple of categories, like Apple Care, because many of the points of sale and stores were closed, and advertising, due to the reduced economic activity, that were negatively affected during COVID. 

During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth in Apple Care, and obviously, we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. Advertising, obviously, has improved as consumer sentiment has returned, and advertising is coming back. So, the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter. 

As we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories, but in general, I talked during our prepared remarks about a number of things that we always look at around the services business. You know, how many new paid accounts do we have? What number of new subscriptions do we get? Above all, is our install base continuing to grow? Are we adding new services? Are we improving the quality of the existing services? 

When we look at all these fundamental vectors of our services business, obviously, we feel very good about it.

### Timestamp: 1797.996 - 1920.340 seconds
Got it, that's helpful. And then, Tim, if I could follow up with you. It seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months. I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, have shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering, does that combination of increased usage and unchanged replacement cycles lead to iPhones potentially growing on a multi-year basis? Because naively, I would imagine if I'm using something more, I have to replace it more often. 

So, I would love your perspective, August. Yeah, we're clearly seeing strong performance in both the new-to-iPhone or switcher component and upgraders, as I've mentioned before. In fact, the upgrader segment had the best March quarter that we've ever had. So, that speaks to what you're seeing, I think, a lot. 

It's difficult, being this far into the cycle, to make a statement about the cycle in general because keep in mind that we just launched midway through the Q1 period. We've only been operating for four and a half months or so. But clearly, we like what we see right now a lot. 

If you look at how the iPhone performed around the world, we had the top five models of smartphones in the U.S., the top two in urban China, four out of the top five in Japan, the top four in the U.K., and the top six in Australia. So, it was a strong performance across the board in some really key countries. I do think that the 5G cycle is important, and we're in the early days of it, frankly.

### Timestamp: 1923.884 - 1927.348 seconds
Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 1928.492 - 2122.836 seconds
Absolutely. We will take our next question from Katie Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Thank you. This was a pretty unbelievable quarter, and investors are going to ask about the sustainability of current demand trends, especially as you lap some of the benefits from COVID in areas like services and Macs later this year. 

So, I know you don't guide beyond or provide an outlook beyond the next quarter, but can you talk from a high level over the next year? Which segments do you see the opportunity to maintain strong revenue growth versus where is it reasonable to assume there will be some digestion as consumers shift their spending priorities? 

Then I have a follow-up for Luca. If you sort of look at the different products, iPhone, I've already mentioned some of the great momentum that we had there. Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year, the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first, and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in the middle part of March. 

And so part of the growth is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future affect primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so we'll have some challenges in there and challenges meeting the demand that we've got. 

The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home and remote learning. And on iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. The product that we just announced is really killer: the iPad Pro with the M1 in it. 

And so there's a lot of great things about the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode. It would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical. 

If you look at wearables, then the watch had a fabulous quarter. I still think we're in the early innings on the watch. The number of new people that are new to the watch is almost 3 out of 4. This is a long way from being a mature market. 

And then the services by itself has really accelerated. All in all, we feel very, very good.

### Timestamp: 2124.620 - 2244.596 seconds
And then, Luca, if I look at inventory plus vendor non-trade receivables, that grew only about 8% this quarter, which is a big deceleration from last quarter. Should we read into that as a leading indicator for the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June? 

As you think about the June quarter, Katie, I would point you to what we said in our prepared remarks around the two factors that will influence our normal seasonality. One is the fact that we launched the iPhone later than usual during this cycle, and so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes, obviously, the sequential decline steeper than usual. 

And then, the $3 or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just mentioned, primarily on iPad and Mac. So, as you look at your model, and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that. 

From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So, we reduced inventory, as is typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range. I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward, obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPhone and the Mac. We wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac, but this is all a function of high demand for all our products.

### Timestamp: 2247.564 - 2252.308 seconds
Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 2253.452 - 2258.036 seconds
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

### Timestamp: 2259.180 - 2375.124 seconds
Yes, thank you. Tim, your content offerings are still at very compelling price points. You have seen other content providers, whether it be Spotify, Hulu, or Netflix, all announce price increases recently. I am just wondering how you are thinking about pricing as it pertains to your offering here, and if you could share any stats around the uptake of TV Plus paid subscriptions, that would be great. 

Let me start with TV Plus. TV Plus is going very well. As you know, the objective and the philosophy that we have had on TV Plus is to create high-quality original content and to be one of the most desired platforms for storytellers. I see that happening day by day as we sign more shows and more storytellers, including Malala, as I mentioned in my opening comments. 

To date, the Apple originals have received 352 award nominations and had 98 wins. This includes everything from Oscar nominations to Emmy awards to Critics' Choice Awards and all the rest. We have some shows that have garnered significant buzz, like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Defending Jacob, and many others. We feel really good about where we are. 

We are not releasing subscriber numbers, but we feel good about our position. In terms of other services and pricing, I don't have anything to announce today. We try to give the customer great value, and we feel that we're doing that with the prices that we've got. We'll see where we go from here.

### Timestamp: 2376.844 - 2444.532 seconds
Okay, thanks, Tim. As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low teens percent that we have seen historically, are the supply constraints of the 3-4 billion impact included in that, or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you are referring to? And if so, what specifically is driving the supply constraints at the subcomponent level? Thank you. 

Yeah, so when you look at our normal seasonality, and you mentioned a percentage there that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. It's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter, and the 3-4 billion supply constraints that we mentioned.

### Timestamp: 2445.868 - 2498.292 seconds
Yeah, the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting many industries. It's a combination of the shortages as well as the very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, just to put it into context, the last three quarters of Mac have been the best three quarters ever in the history of the product. We are experiencing an incredible level of demand, which is certainly favored by the working from home and learning from home environment, but also by the incredible amount of new products and innovations that we launched during the last couple of quarters.

### Timestamp: 2500.108 - 2504.468 seconds
Thank you, Luca. Thanks, Ramji. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 2506.252 - 2510.324 seconds
Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

### Timestamp: 2511.372 - 2579.668 seconds
Yeah, thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the great quarter. I wanted to go back to the iPhone. As we think about the iPhone 12 cycle, appreciating that you guys don't give actual shipment numbers, it would appear, though, that the mix has been quite healthy. So, I'm wondering if you could give us any context on what you're seeing in this cycle in terms of the mix relative to past cycles. Is that mix sustainable? I'm just trying to understand the mix within the iPhones and how that's driving, I guess, particularly gross margin. 

And I have a follow-up. Aaron, let me give you a little color on that. Of the iPhone 12 family, or more broadly, in fact, all iPhones, the iPhone 12 is the most popular. However, we did see very strong sales of the pro portions of the family as well, including the Pro and the Pro Max. So, the revenue that you're seeing is a function of unit growth and revenue per unit growth.

### Timestamp: 2580.876 - 2582.324 seconds
Does that help?

### Timestamp: 2583.948 - 2608.916 seconds
Yeah, can you give any context on how that might have changed this cycle relative to the prior cycles? Have we seen a structural change in the higher band of the product category that you believe can be sustained going forward? You know, we don't predict going forward, other than for our own internal use, but we're really happy with the results.

### Timestamp: 2610.412 - 2679.540 seconds
Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up back to the supply constraints, I guess it's hard to kind of see, you know, again, looking forward beyond this quarter. But what's your best assessment of when maybe the supply constraints could ease? Do you have any views on, you know, just the industry in general overcoming some of the supply constraint dynamics? 

Most of our issues are on legacy nodes. And so, on legacy nodes, there are many different people, not only in the same industry but across other industries, that are using legacy nodes. In order to really answer that question accurately, we would need to know the true demand from each of these players and how that's going to change over the next few months. 

It's very, very difficult to give you a good answer. I think we have a good handle on our demand, but, you know, what everybody else is doing, I don't know. And so, we will do our best. That's what I can tell you.

### Timestamp: 2680.908 - 2748.436 seconds
Fair enough. Thank you, Aaron. Can we have our next question, please? We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. 

Yeah, hey guys. Congratulations on a very nice quarter. I have a question regarding semi-supply as well. You just beat by a substantial margin on the top line in the March quarter. I'm curious about what factors worked in your favor to secure that kind of supply that allowed you to exceed expectations by approximately $11 million. 

Additionally, I had a follow-up: we did not experience a material supply shortage in Q2. How were we able to achieve that? You end up collapsing all of your buffers and offsets, and that process occurs throughout the entire supply chain. This enables you to exceed the sales expectations we had when entering the quarter 90 days ago.

### Timestamp: 2751.340 - 2804.820 seconds
That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, I know there's a lot of moving parts, Tim. With the economy sort of reopening here in the U.S., and you mentioned supply constraints possibly affecting the Mac and the iPad, I was curious if I could get your thoughts, maybe just color-wise, on what you would expect for those two categories—Macs and iPads—in the second half of this year. 

Well, we don't predict or guide to product-level detail. We're not even guiding to the top level at this point because of COVID. So, I'll sidestep that question, but I would point to Lucas' earlier comment about the shortages, and those shortages primarily affect the iPad and Mac. Therefore, we expect to be supply-gated, not demand-gated.

### Timestamp: 2808.780 - 2812.116 seconds
Thank you, Harsh. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 2814.060 - 2925.172 seconds
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Canon and Company. Please go ahead.

Yeah, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a fantastic quarter. First question for Tim or Luke: the growth in China was very strong in the March quarter. Can you give some color on what drove the strength? Which hardware products or services enabled that performance in China? 

And then, as a follow-up, we were very pleased with our performance in China. We set a March quarter revenue record and grew strong double digits across each of the product categories. The revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family. 

As I mentioned earlier, you have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries, and so they were relatively more affected in that quarter. That has to be taken into account as you look at the results. 

As I mentioned earlier, we had the top two selling smartphones in urban China, so we're very proud of that. The iPad and Mac both had enormously positive quarters with great strength across the board. We're also seeing a strong reception to the new iPad Pro that we just announced. 

There are a lot of great comments, and about two-thirds of the people buying Mac and iPad were purchasing them for the first time. We're attracting some new customers in China, which is really important to us.

### Timestamp: 2927.308 - 2959.444 seconds
All right, that is very helpful, Tim. As a follow-up, I have a big picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this: One of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risks. I understand it's very hard to handicap that, but I'm curious—do you think that giving more public disclosure on your services business, like the App Store, would help alleviate some of those concerns? Or do you think that would reveal a lot of competitive details? I'm interested to know your thoughts on services disclosure.

### Timestamp: 2961.1 - 3043.924 seconds
I think with the regulatory questions and scrutiny, we have to make sure that we're telling our story and explaining why we do what we do. We're very focused on that. If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not set in stone, and we can adapt and remain flexible with the times. For example, in the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the commission rate for small developers to 15 percent. That was an example of adapting to the times, and we've received a great reception to that. We continue to learn, and it's very important that we're clear about why we do what we do. The idea behind curating the App Store to ensure the privacy and security that our customers want is crucial, and we must convey that in a straightforward manner.

### Timestamp: 3046.604 - 3056.180 seconds
Very helpful. Thanks, Tim. Yep, thank you. Can we have the next question, please? Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Kyle McNeely with Jefferies.

### Timestamp: 3058.060 - 3156.820 seconds
Hi, thanks a lot for the question. One of the things we've been positive about is how growing iPhone sales can prolong watch and AirPods sales, as well as how customers shop the whole store. You mentioned that, through COVID, accessories do much better in a physical store environment, and that's been hard due to the shutdowns, obviously. 

So my question is, have you seen any improvement in the attach rate for the watch and AirPods with the iPhone? Can it get a lot better from here as the environment gets closer to normalization? I think we gain a lot of benefit from our stores when they're open and fully operational. 

We're in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously, but we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores. There are still some stores today that are closed, like those in Michigan and France, and so forth. I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be that as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales. 

Although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment, it's not something that we're not doing well. Online has been much more beneficial and productive than we would have guessed going into this.

### Timestamp: 3159.148 - 3160.820 seconds
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

### Timestamp: 3163.564 - 3230.196 seconds
Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Absolutely. We'll take our next question from David Roy from UBS. Great. Thanks, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Maybe if I could just ask a question. I know it's early days, but do you have any commentary or insights from the developer community on AppTrack, particularly regarding AT2? What does the initial feedback and data look like that you could share with us? 

Thanks. AT2's focus is really on the user and giving them the ability to decide whether they want to be tracked or not. It puts the user in control, not Apple or any other company, but the user themselves regarding their tracking preferences. That's really the focus of it. The feedback we've received from users, both before it went live during the planning stages and afterward, has been tremendous. We are truly standing up on behalf of the consumer here.

### Timestamp: 3232.012 - 3267.476 seconds
Well, maybe just as a quick follow-up, Tim, can you discuss what the downloads have looked like? I know we just rolled out earlier this week and the acceptance by the consumer at this point. Are there any metrics that you can share with us, whether it's an opt-in or opt-out perspective from the consumer? I don't even know the answer to that. It's not something we would have predicted beforehand. And frankly, even if it's a very low number of people who don't want to be tracked, it's worth doing because those individuals should have the right to make their own decisions about whether they would like to be tracked or not.

### Timestamp: 3269.420 - 3270.676 seconds
Great, thanks.

### Timestamp: 3271.724 - 3274.452 seconds
Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?

### Timestamp: 3275.980 - 3279.572 seconds
Absolutely. We'll take our next question from Sandy P. Morgan.

### Timestamp: 3284.108 - 3429.268 seconds
Couple, I just want to get into the performance by geography here a bit. Europe has shown really exceptional results, particularly for this time of the year. Tim, I know you mentioned some of the 5G iPhone upgrades are in front of you, and I would assume Europe is kind of in that category. I'm curious to hear, or maybe if you can double-click on what's driving the exceptional growth here in Europe. Are consumers moving to 5G phones even though some of the service provider plans are not rolled out, or are we still expecting that to be much more in front of us?

Yes, I'll take that one. You're right; we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter, and it was probably one of the geographies where we actually saw results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board in every product category, particularly in iPad and Mac. They really were very, very strong.

Again, obviously, Europe has been affected by lockdowns more than most parts of the world. The lockdowns have lasted longer than here in the United States, for example. Tim was mentioning there are places in Europe still today where our stores are closed. Fortunately, we have a very strong online business that has really helped us. Working from home, learning from home, and limited entertainment options have all played in our favor.

Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes Western Europe, which has done very, very well, and then Eastern Europe. It also extends into the Middle East; even India is part of Europe, and those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than the company average. So, I am very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, as well as in Russia and the Middle East in general. It's been very broad, both across the product categories and across countries in Europe.

### Timestamp: 3433.004 - 3560.404 seconds
I think overall, I just wanted to understand the implications of the investment plans that you announced recently for the U.S., the $430 billion over a multi-year period. I'm getting some questions from investors about how to think about the implications on the run rate of operating expenses for the company. 

If you remember, we announced back in 2018 that we were making a very sizable commitment to the United States. At the time, we announced $350 billion of investment over the following five years. During these three years since then, we've overachieved on those commitments, and we felt it was the right time to update this type of investment. 

These investments span from, obviously, the investment that we made directly at Apple. For example, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years in the United States. Of course, our business has grown, and so our commitment, for example, to U.S. suppliers grows over time, and that shows in the higher numbers. 

In the meantime, we've entered new businesses; for example, Apple TV+. A lot of the content that we develop for our TV service is produced here in the United States, and so that's additional investment here in the United States. 

From an OPEX standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years, you know, we’ve said many times, sometimes our OPEX grows faster than revenue, and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our OPEX increase, but we want to continue to make all the necessary investments into the business. 

We will never underinvest in our business, and so you will continue to see that we will continue to grow our operating expenses, particularly on the R&amp;D side, which continues to be the core of the company.
