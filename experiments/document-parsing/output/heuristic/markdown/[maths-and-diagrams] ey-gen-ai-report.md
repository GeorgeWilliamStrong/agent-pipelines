                                              what you see by feeding a stream of vision data back
                                              to a foundation model. In November 2023, Open AI
                                              launched GPT 4 Turbo with 128K context window,
                                              which means you can pack 300 pages of a book in a
                                              single prompt. And that too at 2X to 3X lower cost of
                                              GPT 4. Open AI also launched GPTs that are no code
                                              tools to create Gen AI chat apps and also platforms
                                              to buy and sell these GPT apps on GPT store, with
                                              the aim of becoming the iOS or Android of the Gen AI
                                              ecosystem.

                                               The open source movement to build
                                               foundation models has accelerated

                                              Open source models are available for commercial
                                              use; they can be downloaded and used. This is
                                              distinct from the application programming interface
                                              (API) model initiated by Open AI. Companies can
                                              download and fine tune open source models for
                    even structured data stores and we expect answers
                                              specific purposes. In fact, this is a key trigger for

                    tasks on which they were not specifically trained –

                    data which is arguably one of the key measures of
                    intelligence.

                    All this happened in a few months. It is worth taking
                    a few minutes to record the advances we have seen
                    in 2023.                                 Creativity is intelligence

                    Working with these models requires enterprises
                    to plan and build a strong foundation for
                    effective deployment.

                    Closed Source LLMs are ideal for getting started,

## G
   Technical Appendix

 Our methodology for estimating the economic impact of Gen AI on the Indian economy utilizes a macro framework
 in combination with survey-based inputs on the sectoral impact of Gen AI. The survey has been conducted across
 the 27 sectors of the economy as per the KLEMS database (RBI). The survey gathers inputs from EY’s sector
 leaders whose assessments are based on their expertise and close interaction with clients. These clients include key
 players in their respective industry. The survey primarily captures the efficiency effects of Gen AI adoption in terms
 of expected cost reduction and output expansion1 over a seven-year period starting 2023-24 to 2029-30.

 These inputs have then been incorporated in a macro framework to estimate the potential additional contribution
 to India’s GVA by 2029-30 on account of Gen AI adoption. The impact of Gen AI on India’s GVA can be explained in
 three steps:

 01
  Estimation of sectoral impact of Gen AI on the organized segment of each sector

 The following variables have been used in the estimation framework:

  Table 1: List of variables



# | Variable | Description
| --- | --- | --- |
1 | |GVA of the ith sector
2 | |Gross output of the ith sector
3 | |Intermediate consumption of the ith sector
4 | |share of the unorganized segment of ith sector
5 | |Gen AI impact in terms of percentage change in sector i’s GVA
6 | |Additional nominal sectoral GVA in the terminal year 2029-30 on account of<br>Gen AI
7 | |Base GVA magnitudes for 2029-30 excluding the effect of Gen AI for each sector
8 | |total additional GVA for the economy as a whole on account of Gen AI in the<br>terminal year 2029-30

Using (a) cost reduction and output expansion effects (in percentage terms) captured through the survey and
(b) ratio of output and intermediate inputs relative to value added estimated from KLEMS database, we have
assessed the impact of Gen AI on the organized segment of sector i’s GVA (in % terms) through the following
equation (1)2

Where is the GVA of the ith sector (avg. of 2017-18 to 2019-20 from KLEMS); is the gross output of the
ith sector (avg. of 2017-18 to 2019-20 from KLEMS); is the intermediate consumption of the ith sector
(avg. of 2017-18 to 2019-20 from KLEMS)

02
 Estimation of sectoral impact of Gen AI on each sector’s total GVA

Impact of Gen AI on total GVA (organized + unorganized)3 of sector i (in % terms) is given by equation (2)

Where is the share of the unorganized segment of ith sector. The share of unorganized segment of each sector
has been sourced from the IMF for the year 2017-18. The shares provided by the RBI for the unorganized segment
have been used for the manufacturing sub sectors.

03
 Estimation of the magnitude of sectoral impact of Gen AI

The magnitude of additional nominal sectoral GVA in the terminal year 2029-30 (ḥ ) on account of
Gen AI is estimated by applying the Gen AI impact ( ) on the base GVA (BGVA) magnitudes (which does not
include the effect of Gen AI) for each sector

Hence the total additional GVA for the economy as a whole in the terminal year 2029-30 can be given by

The augmented overall GVA which includes the additional GVA due to Gen AI + Base GVA (ḥ ) in the
terminal year of 2029-30 can be written as

Further,

1 It is assumed that the expansion in output on account of Gen AI adoption will be absorbed by the creation of corresponding demand in the economy.
2 The derivation of equation (1) is given below:
Gross output (O) = Total input cost [energy + material + services] (I) + GVA (V)
O= I+ V
V= O-I
(V+ ∆V)=(O+∆O)-(I+∆I)
The output expansion and cost reduction effects of the adoption of Gen AI can then be incorporated in the above equation as:

3 We implicitly assume that the impact of Gen AI on the unorganized sector may be insignificant considering the requirement of relatively higher levels of investment
 in technological infrastructure and skilled workforce to adopt the new technology.
