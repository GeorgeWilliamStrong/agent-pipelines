# Understanding       RAG    (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large
Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with a retrieval system that fetches
relevant information from a knowledge base before generating responses. This
approach helps improve accuracy and provides up-to-date information while
reducing hallucinations.

# How   RAG    Works

 1. Query Processing : When a user asks a question, the system processes it to
   understand the information needed.
 2. Retrieval : The system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant
   documents or passages.
 3. Augmentation : Retrieved information is combined with the original query.
 4. Generation : The LLM uses both the query and retrieved information to
   generate an accurate response.

# Benefits   of RAG

 ●  Improved accuracy and reliability
 ●  Reduced hallucinations
 ●  Access to up-to-date information
 ●  Better handling of domain-specific knowledge
 ●  Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
 ●  Enhanced transparency and traceability
