                                                                                         in  GenAI     usage.

Organizations        are  using    – or  planning     to  use   – GenAI     across    multiple     departments.
                                                                                            To   what    extent    is  your   organization       using    GenAI?
A  massive      86%    of  respondents       have    either   begun     to  deploy    GenAI     across    sales
                                                                                            (%   currently     using)
departments         or are   planning     to  do  so.

For   marketing,      that  figure   is  85%;   for  IT  81%;   and   for  finance     it’s 75%.   Even    in those
departments         where    GenAI     adoption      is least   likely,  the  majority     are  still  either
using    or planning     to  bring   it on   board;   59%    in  HR   and   49%    in  legal  departments.         A
fifth  of  the   workforce      (20%)    currently     use   GenAI     tools   to  generate     text,   images     or
video    every    day.

As   organizations       adopt    GenAI,     they   seek   to  understand        how    to use   it safely    and
ethically.    Nearly    two-thirds      (61%)   have    a GenAI     usage     policy   in place,    indicating
that   even    where    governance        is patchy,    leaders    are   making     efforts   to  standardize
GenAI     usage.    Almost     half   (46%)    are  planning     to  enlist   third-party      support     to
ensure     that  they    make    the   most    of  GenAI’s     potential.

                                                                                                                                           31   / 38

Many     are   enlisting    third   parties    to  support      GenAI     integration,      including     through     orchestration        platforms.

  How    do   you   envision     scaling    GenAI     within    your    business      processes?

GenAI     and   LLMs     can   augment,      accelerate      and   streamline      processes      across    an
organization.       However,      to  solve   industry-specific        problems      and    deliver   value,
these    pioneering      technologies       require    support.     Organizations        need    systems
and   technology       that   integrate     LLMs     with   their  existing    processes,      providing
governance        and   decisioning      capabilities.    Human       intervention      is necessary      to
maintain      and   govern    them.
