### Organizations are reporting early successes  

Since the widespread launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, GenAI has emerged as a technology with extraordinary potential. Decision makers recognize that GenAI can drive innovation, new conversational experiences and operational efficiency.  

Our research shows that organizations that embrace GenAI are seeing significant benefits.  

- **89%** report improved employee experience and satisfaction  
- **82%** say that they are making savings on operational costs  
- **82%** state that customer retention is higher  

However, with increased focus on and investment in GenAI, many organizations are encountering difficulties with implementation. These issues threaten to waste resources, dissuade customers and even render organizations legally noncompliant. In organizations that have fully implemented GenAI projects, 39% are finding it a challenge to integrate GenAI technology into existing systems, while 34% are struggling with prohibitive costs. These issues are best resolved at an early stage, ideally before GenAI is deployed and significant resources are invested.  

Our research shows that while organizations expect to have GenAI successes, they hit stumbling blocks in four areas of implementation:  
- Increasing trust in data usage and achieving compliance. Embedding trust in your business outcomes.  
- Unlocking value. Translating adoption into measurable benefits.  
- Orchestrating GenAI into existing systems and processes. Ensuring that systems and tools do not limit GenAI’s potential.  
- Finding talent and skills. Identifying the talent who can support your GenAI strategy.

### a. Comprehensive governance: Increasing trust in data usage and achieving regulatory compliance

When a GenAI investment performs reliably, transparently, and ethically, organizations see the benefits. However, many lack full oversight of the technology, and the majority are at risk of noncompliance when it comes to quickly evolving regulations.

Our research finds that:

- Only one in 10 organizations has undergone the preparation needed to comply with GenAI regulations.
- 95% of businesses lack a comprehensive governance framework for GenAI.
- Fewer than one in 10 organizations (7%) is providing a high level of training on GenAI governance and monitoring.
- Three-quarters of respondents are concerned about data privacy (76%) and security (75%) when GenAI is used in their organization.
- Only one in 20 organizations (5%) has a reliable system in place to measure bias and privacy risk in LLMs.
- Seven in 10 organizations are not able to continuously monitor their GenAI systems.

| Limited or ad hoc monitoring           | 23%        |
| External audits and assessments        | 11%        |
| We do not have a monitoring system in place | 12%   |

*Monitoring of IT systems and networks to detect security threats, performance issues, or non-compliance problems in an automated manner to identify and address potential problems and threats in real time.

Across all organizations, GenAI use can create anxieties about data privacy, security, lack of governance, dependence on the technology, and its potential for amplifying bias.

Many of these organizations have not fully prepared themselves to comply with regulations and do not have GenAI governance in place or ways to monitor the technology.

Our research shows that businesses are rushing into GenAI before establishing adequate systems of governance, which could result in serious issues with quality and compliance later.
# Insight 2:
Asia Pacific countries (mainly China) are ahead in their preparation to comply with GenAI regulations.

## How prepared is your organization to comply with current and upcoming regulations concerning GenAI?

| Preparedness Level       | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Fully prepared           | 57%        |
| Moderately prepared       | 49%        |
| Slightly prepared        | 28%        |
| Not prepared             | 2%         |

- **All respondents using/planning to use GenAI**
- **North America**
- **LATAM**
- **Northern Europe**

## b. Strategic deployment: Translating implementation into measurable benefits

The ideal GenAI investment offers clear opportunities for efficiency and a better customer experience, but many organizations report gaps in strategic thinking that are affecting successful rollout:

- Nine in 10 senior tech decision makers (93%) admit that they do not fully understand GenAI or its potential impact on business processes.
- Almost half (47%) are encountering challenges in transitioning from concept to practical use of GenAI.
- More than a third (37%) foresee difficulty proving that GenAI offers a strong ROI or have found this hard to prove.
- Fewer than half (45%) of CIOs and around a third (36%) of CTOs consider themselves extremely familiar with GenAI adoption in their organizations.
- Four in 10 organizations (39%) do not have a GenAI usage policy in place for their staff.

The countries that we surveyed show a wide range of responses in terms of their GenAI strategy. Those who report that they face the most challenges transitioning the technology from concept to practical use include Spain (where 67% of respondents say this is a challenge) and Poland (64%), while the countries who are most confident doing so include Canada (39%), Mexico (40%) and France (40%). Looking at regional trends, 71% of APAC companies are managing their GenAI usage with an internal policy, in contrast to 52% of LATAM respondents.

Respondents in manufacturing (where 61% have a good or complete understanding), life sciences (55%) and telco (55%) report the highest levels of personal understanding where GenAI is concerned. Respondents in the public sector are much less confident in their understanding of GenAI (only 38% say they understand it well or completely).

## c. Technological integration: Ensuring that your systems and tools do not limit GenAI’s potential

At best, GenAI is seamlessly embedded within an organization’s processes and systems. But many companies struggle to integrate the technology with their existing tasks and tools.

Our research finds that:

- Almost half (47%) of decision makers report that they do not have appropriate tools to implement GenAI.
- Four in 10 (41%) are experiencing compatibility issues when they try to combine GenAI with their current systems.
- Half of decision makers (52%) are encountering obstacles in using public and proprietary data sets effectively.
- Over a third (34%) say that the biggest challenge to monitoring GenAI is technological limitations.
- Countries struggling to find the tools and expertise they need to implement GenAI include those in LATAM (57% say they don’t have the tools, and 52% don’t have the expertise). In contrast, only about a third (36%) of respondents in the APAC region (including only 31% in China) say they don’t have the appropriate tools to implement GenAI. Moreover, only 31% in this region say they don’t have the internal expertise to do so (21% in China).

When it comes to monitoring GenAI, some sectors believe they are limited by their access to technology, particularly manufacturing (42%), health care (40%) and retail (40%). Least likely to agree with this are professional services (25%) and telco organizations (28%).

“LLMs alone do not solve business problems. GenAI is nothing more than a feature that can augment your existing processes, but you need tools that enable their integration, governance, and orchestration. And most importantly, you need people that can use tools to ensure the appropriate level of orchestration.”  
Marinela Profi,  
Strategic AI Advisor at SAS

### Insight 5:
Make sure that your GenAI software vendors can integrate with existing workflow and decisioning platforms.  
GenAI is an ideal contributor to hyper-automation, which facilitates the automation of all feasible tasks within an organization. It excels in summarizing vast amounts of data to support decisioning workflows, enabling real-time interactions aligned with your preferred business processes.

### Insight 6:
Using a decisioning workflow system to infuse GenAI into existing business processes facilitates measurable outcomes.  
LLMs can only execute a few tasks of a use case. Organizations still need an end-to-end process that orchestrates the AI life cycle while enhancing the transparency and governance of LLMs.
d. Expert guidance: Resourcing challenges with scarcity of GenAI skill sets

For many organizations, it really comes down to this: In-house GenAI expertise is lacking. As HR departments encounter a scarcity of suitable hires, organizations worry that they do not have access to the necessary skills to make the most of their GenAI investment.

Our research finds that:

- Half of organizations (51%) are concerned that they do not have the in-house skills to use the technology effectively.
- Around four in 10 respondents (39%) say they have found insufficient internal expertise to be an obstacle to implementing GenAI.
- North America and the APAC region have slightly less difficulty accessing GenAI skills (44% and 49% report this to be an issue), in contrast with Northern Europe (54%) and the rest of Europe (56%).
- Industries reporting that a lack of internal expertise is a barrier to implementing GenAI include manufacturing (48%), health care (43%) and the public sector (43%). Telco companies (24%) are less affected.

Lack of internal expertise is a particular issue for those in health care and the public sector.

## 04
GenAI adoption rates will continue to grow

The research reveals that more than half of businesses (54%) have begun to implement GenAI, including 11% that have fully integrated the technology at an enterprise level. The vast majority (86%) of companies are investing in GenAI this year and next. One in five plan to roll out GenAI at the enterprise level, and 72% are undertaking or planning to embark on projects to build their own LLMs.

As you will see in the charts below, there are regional differences in GenAI implementation: China, the UK, the US, Australia and Germany are ahead of the curve in adoption of the technology. Organizations in the US are further ahead with full implementation. By sector, telco companies have reached a more advanced stage than the rest, followed by retail, insurance, banking and life sciences. Manufacturing, the public sector and health care organizations are behind the curve.

# Blueprint for gaining a competitive advantage

It is crucial that GenAI projects are built in a way that not only meet current needs but are also prepared for future growth and innovation.

For a successful GenAI program, you should have a clear strategy for each of the following areas:

- **Accelerated innovation.** Seamlessly integrate GenAI models into decisioning workflows, AI and machine learning applications, and existing business processes by using decisioning flow tools such as intelligent decisioning.

- **Data protection.** Ensure user privacy and security with robust data quality measures – including synthetic data generation, data minimization, anonymization and encryption – that provide sensitive information safeguards.

- **Trustworthy and explainable results.** Data experts can apply natural language processing techniques to preprocess data, explain the generated output in easily understandable terms, minimize hallucinations and reduce token costs.

- **Enhanced governance.** Use built-in workflows that validate the entire life cycle of LLMs, from regulatory compliance to model risk management.
